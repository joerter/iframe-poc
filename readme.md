# IFrame POC

This repo is a proof of concept for dynamic resizing and scaling of iframes.

An example responsive app is located here: https://laughing-ardinghelli-b931ed.netlify.app/iframe.html

This app is iframed into the main app here: https://laughing-ardinghelli-b931ed.netlify.app

The main app contains three iframes at mobile, desktop, and tablet screen sizes. When the screen is resized, the screens retain their
proper dimensions and scale the iframe accordingly. The inner iframes dimensions do not change so that the app can be seen properly on each device.
